## News

üî• October, 2024: We have added feature for single audio inference on our SepReformer-B for WSJ0-2MIX in `models/SepReformer_Base_WSJ0`. You can directly inference by your own samples!

üî• October, 2024: We have uploaded the pre-trained models of our SepReformer-B for WSJ0-2MIX in `models/SepReformer_Base_WSJ0/log/scratch_weight` folder! You can directly test the model using the inference command below.

üî• September 2024, Paper accepted at NeurIPS 2024 üéâ.


## Todo
We are planning to release the other cases especially for partially or fully overlapped, noisy-reverberant mixture with 16k of sampling rates for practical application within this year.

We  propose SepReformer, a novel approach to speech separation using an asymmetric encoder-decoder network.

## Environment Preparation
```bash
conda create -n SepReformer python=3.10
conda activate SepReformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Pretrained Models

We offer a pretrained model for our SepReformer-B. (other models will be uploaded, soon)

This repository uses **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** to manage pretrained model files. If Git LFS is not installed, large files may not be downloaded properly. **Please install Git LFS before cloning this repository.**

- Installing and Setting Up Git LFS

1. **Install Git LFS**

   Git LFS is an extension for Git that allows handling large files. You can install it, for example in Ubuntu, with the following commands:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git-lfs
     ```
2. **Initialize Git LFS**

   Before cloning the repository, initialize Git LFS with the following command:

   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```   

## Data Preparation

- For training or evaluation, you need dataset and scp file
    1. Prepare dataset for speech separation (eg. WSJ0-2mix)
    2. create scp file using data/create_scp/*.py

## Training

- If you want to train the network, you can simply trying by
    - set the scp file in ‚Äòmodels/SepReformer_Base_WSJ0/configs.yaml‚Äô
    - run training as
        
        ```bash
        python run.py --model SepReformer_Base_WSJ0 --engine-mode train
        ```

### Inference on a single audio sample

- Simply Inference on a single audio with output wav files saved

    ```bash
    python run.py --model SepReformer_Base_WSJ0 --engine-mode infer_sample --sample-file /to/your/sample/dir/
    ```

- For example, you can directly test by using the included sample as

    ```bash
    python run.py --model SepReformer_Base_WSJ0 --engine-mode infer_sample --sample-file ./sample_wav/sample_WSJ.wav
    ```


## Test on Dataset

- Evaluating a model on dataset without saving output as audio files
    
    ```bash
    python run.py --model SepReformer_Base_WSJ0 --engine-mode test
    ```
    

- Evaluating on dataset with output wav files saved
    
    ```bash
    python run.py --model SepReformer_Base_WSJ0 --engine-mode test_wav --out_wav_dir '/your/save/directoy[optional]'
    ```
    

## Training Curve
- For SepReformer-B with WSJ-2MIX, the training and validation curve is as follows:
